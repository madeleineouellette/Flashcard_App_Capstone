# Flashcard-O-Matic

Flashcard-O-Matic is an app that enables users to create a deck of flashcards, manipulate that deck (add, edit, delete cards), and study it. 

Unique feature allowed users to maximize study effectiveness by clicking a “Flip” button to look at either side of the card and a “Next” button to move on to the next card.
